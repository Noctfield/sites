== Hello, I'm Blair Noctis.

I'm largely a self-taught & self-driven developer, because I love to create useful, good things.

I use mostly Python when programming, with growing interest in Rust. TypeScript is preferred when writing Web stuff for its efficiency and elegance.
Here is my https://github.com/Noctfied[GitHub profile]. There's nothing much for now,
but I'm working on changing that.

When not programming, I read books, play games, eat things, and watch films.

Books are an important part of my life. Talk is cheap, books are concentrated.

My favorite game is Watch_Dogs. You can find me https://steamcommunity.com/id/noctfield[on Steam].

You can find my PGP keys https://keybase.io/noctfield[on Keybase].
Say hello by https://is.gd/contactbn[email] or https://t.me/BlairNoctisPMBot[Telegram].
